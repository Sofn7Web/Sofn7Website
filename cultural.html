            <h2>A special note from Susan Strang - Cultural Director for District #7</h2>
            <div>This page began as a way to get some of my lodge members in Varden Lodge, who don't attend meetings to stay more involved with the lodge.  Because we missed Heritage Camp and the Border Festival, these people were missing their usual summertime events, and COVID was a great incentive to start something new online. I decided to try this as an experiment to see what kind of "buy in" I would get. It was so successful that I thought I would arrange to post it to our website for others to access. <br><br>

                We are going to have five sessions (one per month) to complete level one of the Norwegian Cooking Culture pin. I have 4 people who could not attend the session but are going to be part of the group and plan to make the first recipe on their own. It's easy, so they can certainly do that. My vision is to see us develop classes in cooking and other culture skills for people to access through the website. I know of instructors who I am sure would be willing to do a 30 minute session if we had lessons available online. <br><br>
                
                We have created a YouTube channel to post the videos on.  You can find the link for the first cooking video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htsLyerczP4">HERE</a>.  This is my first attempt at recording a zoom conference, and it's not perfect, but the pace is fine for people to bake along with me.  The recipes will also be provided as downloadable .PDF files.

                    Each year, the Foundation tracks all the gifts received from the Canadian Lodges in District 4 and
                    District 7.  The total gifts received from a Lodge in that year are then divided by the number of adult members in that Lodge to determine a dollar value per member.  The Lodge with the highest dollar value
                    per member receives the “Founder’s Award”.  These are generally presented at the Foundation’s Annual General Meeting.
